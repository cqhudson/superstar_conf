Running `setup.sh` will overwrite existing config files. Run at your own risk!

Superstar Conf is a running set of configs I'm putting together for a more sane linux developer experience.

This will likely stay pretty small, as straying too far from defaults can be counterproductive in certain circumstances. 
However, there are small changes that can be made to make the developer experience more convenient. 

This set of configs target Ubuntu, though I imagine they will work across most Linux distros.
